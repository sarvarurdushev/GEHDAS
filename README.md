# Key Contributions / Description:

Developed and implemented a comprehensive, interactive database application for exoplanet discovery and habitability assessment, simulating a critical tool for astronomical research and strategic resource allocation.

Designed and managed a complex relational database schema (SQL) for over 6 interrelated tables, accurately modeling astrophysical data including star systems, exoplanets, discovery missions, atmospheric analysis, and habitability scores.

Leveraged advanced SQL techniques (multi-table JOINs, aggregations, subqueries, window functions) to extract critical insights, identify top habitable planet candidates, analyze mission performance, and trend discovery patterns.

Integrated complex astronomical calculations (e.g., Earth Similarity Index, Habitable Zone modeling) to quantitatively assess planetary habitability and prioritize targets for further study.

Created dynamic, interactive dashboards and visualizations (Matplotlib, ipywidgets) to enable rapid data exploration, identify key trends, and support data-driven decision-making for hypothetical resource deployment to promising exoplanets.

Demonstrated strong analytical and problem-solving skills by structuring an intricate dataset to address a multifaceted scientific challenge, translating raw data into actionable insights for strategic planning in exoplanetary exploration.
